reports to the **Reports** section of the CMS. These will allow you to identify and find content within blocks quickly.

## Content block types

This report will list all types of content blocks in your system, as well as how many times they have been
used to create content.

Navigating to the **Reports** section in the CMS menu and select the report ***Content block types***.
